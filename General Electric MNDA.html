<p></p>
<p>MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT</p>
<p>THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is made and entered into as of January 20, 2015 (the “Effective Date”) by and between INSERT SUPPLIER LEGAL ENTITY,  a INSERT SUPPLIER REGISTERED ENTITY LOCATION/TYPE with its principal place of business at INSERT SUPPLIER ADDRESS (“Service Provider”) and General Electric Corporation, a New York Corporation, with its principal place of business at 3135 Easton Turnpike, Fairfield, CT 06341 (“GE”).</p>
<p>    1. Purpose.  GE and Service Provider desire to engage in discussions concerning a team communication tool, platform independent, fully searchable with high availability and historic retention coupled with multiple notifications and capable of a bevy full of  integrations  (the “Engagement”), and in connection therewith, GE and Service Provider may disclose to each other certain Confidential Information (as defined below), which GE and Service Provider agree to treat in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>    2. “Confidential Information” means any and all technical or non-technical information whether communicated orally, visually, in writing or in any other medium related to a party’s past, present or future research, financial, development, business activities and programs, or intellectual property, or any information concerning GE’s personnel and clients, regardless of whether that information is exchanged before or after the Effective Date.  Confidential Information shall also include any unannounced product(s) or service(s) of either party, and any other information or materials provided to a receiving party and designated by the disclosing party as confidential or proprietary, or, if not so designated, that the receiving party would reasonably be expected to assume is confidential due to its nature.  Confidential Information further includes, without limitation, the existence of this Agreement and its terms and conditions.  Confidential Information shall not, however, include any information which (a) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (b) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the disclosing party to the receiving party through no action or inaction of the receiving party; (c) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party as shown by the receiving party’s files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (d) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party without a breach of such third party’s obligations of confidentiality; (e) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in the receiving party’s possession; or (f) is required by law to be disclosed by the receiving party, provided that the receiving party gives the disclosing party prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such disclosure and assistance in obtaining an order protecting the information from public disclosure.  The parties do not wish to receive any Confidential Information that is not necessary to achieve the purpose of this Agreement.</p>
<p>    3. Scope.  This Agreement relates solely to Confidential Information disclosed in connection with the Engagement, and nothing herein shall be construed or interpreted to amend, limit, or modify any other nondisclosure agreement(s) that may now, or in the future, be in effect between the parties, and/or their respective affiliates, in connection with other matters. </p>
<p>    4. Non-use and Non-disclosure.  Each party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except in connection with the Engagement.  Each party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to third parties, or to such party's employees, except to those employees of the receiving party who are required to have the information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the contemplated business relationship.  Neither party shall reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other tangible objects which embody the other party's Confidential Information and which are provided to the party hereunder.</p>
<p>    5. Maintenance of Confidentiality.  Each party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own Confidential Information, and represents and warrants, on their own behalf, that all of their officers, employees, and agents who have access to Confidential Information of the other party, are aware of (or will, prior to their being given access to any Confidential Information under this Agreement, be made aware of) the terms of this Agreement so that they may sufficiently protect the considerable interest of the other party’s Confidential Information.  Neither party shall make any copies of the Confidential Information of the other party except for the limited purpose of making secondary copies for officers, employees, and agents on a need to know basis.  Each party shall reproduce the other party's proprietary rights notices on any such copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.  Each party shall immediately notify the other party in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information.</p>
<p>    6. No Obligation.  Nothing herein shall obligate either party to proceed with any transaction between them, and each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the Engagement.  This Agreement does not constitute a joint venture or other such business agreement.  Any such relationship between the parties will only be as set forth in a separate written agreement.</p>
<p>    7. No Warranty.  ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS.”  EACH PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE.</p>
<p>    8. No Liability.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE DISCLOSING PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE RECEIVING PARTY FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF REVENUE OR LOSS OF GOODWILL ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISCLOSING PARTY’S PROVISION OF OR THE RECEIVING PARTY’S USE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, EVEN IF THE DISCLOSING PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF, EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING FROM WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD.</p>
<p>    9. Return of Materials.  All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information which have been disclosed by either party to the other party, and all copies thereof which are in the possession of the other party, shall be and remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be promptly returned to the disclosing party upon the disclosing party's written request.  However, the written party shall have the right, subject to its continuing confidentiality obligations, to retain copies of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable law or regulatory requirement.</p>
<p>    10. Ownership of Confidential Information.  The receiving party acknowledges that, as between the parties, all Confidential Information it receives from the disclosing party, including all copies thereof in the receiving party’s possession or control, in any media, is proprietary to and exclusively owned by the disclosing party.  Nothing in this Agreement grants the receiving party any right, title or interest in or to any of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.  The receiving party’s incorporation of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information into any of its own materials shall not render Confidential Information non-confidential.  The receiving party shall not use (except as expressly provided herein), commercialize or license to any third party any of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information or any product or system relating to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, nor file a patent application or seek other protection or proprietary right incorporating the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.</p>
<p>    11. Third Party Rights.  The disclosing party represents that it may lawfully disclose its Confidential Information to the receiving party, and that such disclosure will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise constitute an improper disclosure of a third party’s trade secrets or confidential information.</p>
<p>    12. Term.  The obligations of this Agreement shall be continuing and binding on both parties until the earlier of (a) the time that the Confidential Information is no longer confidential other than by a breach of this Agreement by either party, or (b) the execution of a definitive agreement between the parties covering the same subject matter as the transaction which includes confidentiality provisions substantially similar to those set forth herein and expressly superseding this Agreement (absent a superseding clause, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to Confidential Information disclosed hereunder); except that protection of trade secrets shall extend for as long as the relevant information qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law.</p>
<p>    13. No Publicity.  Neither party shall use any names, trademarks, service marks, logos or other identifying marks of the other party or its affiliates (unless otherwise agreed to in writing), nor discuss or otherwise make reference to the other party, in any notices to third parties, promotional or marketing materials, press release or other public announcement or advertisement, however characterized, without the other party’s prior written consent. </p>
<p>    14. Remedies.  Each party agrees that any violation or threatened violation of this Agreement may cause irreparable injury to the other party, entitling the other party to seek injunctive relief in addition to all other legal remedies.</p>
<p>    15. Export Control Laws.  The parties acknowledge that certain technical information may be disclosed hereunder that may be subject to the export control laws or regulations of the United States of America.  Each party shall be severally responsible for obtaining any export license required under such laws or regulations with respect to the export of any Confidential Information, and shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the technical information which is subject to the restrictions under such laws or regulations as well as the type of license to have been obtained.  Each party agrees that, unless proper authorization is obtained, it will not export, re-export, or transship, directly or indirectly, any technical information disclosed hereunder, to any country, end user or end use that is prohibited by United States laws.</p>
<p>    16. Counterparts; Electronic Copies of Original Agreement Valid as Original.  For the convenience of the parties, copies of this Agreement pursuant to it may be executed in two or more counterparts. The parties intend that counterpart copies signed and exchanged as provided in the preceding sentence shall be fully binding and all of such copies together shall constitute one instrument.  Facsimiles and scanned images of original signatures are considered valid as original signatures.  In addition, images of the original of this Agreement with original signatures pursuant to it may be stored electronically.  The parties intend that electronic copies or images reproduced from the electronically stored original Agreement shall be valid as an original.</p>

<p>    17. Governing Law.  This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York.  Any action or proceeding brought by any party against another arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be brought in a state or federal court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located within the State of New York, and each of the parties to this Agreement consents to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>    18. Miscellaneous.  This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and assigns.  This document contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and neither party shall have any obligation, express or implied by law, with respect to trade secret or proprietary information of the other party except as set forth herein.  Any failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision.  This Agreement may not be amended, changed, modified, supplemented, or waived nor any obligation waived, except by a written agreement signed by both parties. </p>
