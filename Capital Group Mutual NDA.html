<p></p>
<p>THIS MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made this _____ day of ________________, 20___, by and between ______________________________ (“Company”) and The Capital Group Companies, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “Capital”).  As used herein, the party disclosing Confidential Information is the “Disclosing Party” and the party receiving the Confidential Information is the “Recipient”.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>WITNESSETH:</p>
<p></p>
<p>	WHEREAS, each Disclosing Party possesses, without limitation, certain proprietary financial, marketing, research and development, organizational, technical, business policies or practices, and any non-public personal or financial information received from third parties such as clients or customers of the Disclosing Party that the Disclosing Party is obligated to treat as confidential (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Confidential Information”).

<p></p>
<p>	WHEREAS, the parties would like to conduct discussions relating to a specific business purpose (“Purpose”)</p>
<p></p>
<p>WHEREAS, such discussions between the parties may require that each party disclose some of its Confidential Information to the other;</p>
<p></p>
<p>	WHEREAS, each party is willing to make such disclosure to the other party, but only on a confidential basis and subject to the following terms and conditions;</p>
<p></p>
<p>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the terms and mutual agreements hereinafter contained, the parties do hereby agree as follows: </p>
<p></p>
<p>1.	Each party agrees that it shall use the Confidential Information received from the other hereunder solely for the purposes of conducting discussions in relation to the Purpose.  Additionally, with respect to any portfolio holdings and investment-related information disclosed by the Disclosing Party, if any, Recipient agrees not to trade on any such information.

Recipient further agrees to comply with all applicable federal and state data privacy laws, including any requirements to establish and maintain safeguards and a written information security program.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.	Each party hereby agrees that the Recipient shall maintain in confidence all Confidential Information disclosed to it hereunder by the Disclosing Party (a) in tangible form clearly labeled as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure, (b) if disclosed in non-tangible form, identified as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure, and summarized in writing that is designated as confidential or proprietary and delivered to the Recipient within ten (10) days after disclosure or (c) in such a manner that a reasonable person would understand the confidential nature of the information disclosed.  Recipient shall not permit the disclosure of same to any third party; except when, after and to the extent such Confidential Information (i) was already known to said Recipient prior to the disclosure of same hereunder without obligation of confidentiality, as evidenced by said Recipient's written records prepared prior to such disclosure; (ii) was in or hereafter comes within the public domain, other than by said Recipient's failure to fulfill its obligations hereunder; (iii) is made available to said Recipient by a third party who has lawfully obtained the information and does not have any obligation of secrecy to the Disclosing Party; or (iv) is independently developed by the Recipient without the use or prior access to Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.  </p>

If Recipient requires access of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information by a third party agent, then Recipient agrees to ensure that such agent executes a separate confidentiality agreement with Recipient to ensure protection of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to the same extent that such information is protected under this Agreement.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>4.	No right or license under any patent, trademark, trade secret or copyright now or hereafter owned or controlled by the Disclosing Party shall be implied as having been granted to the Recipient by any disclosure of any Confidential Information made under this Agreement or by any other activity hereunder.  </p>

In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Recipient of any terms of this Agreement, then Disclosing Party shall be entitled to obtain a temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or other equitable relief restraining the breach or threatened breach, and the existence of any claim for damages or other remedy shall not be a defense to any such equitable relief.

<p></p>
<p>    11. The Disclosing Party's waiver of confidentiality with respect to any specific item of Confidential Information disclosed hereunder shall neither constitute nor be construed as a general waiver of confidentiality with respect to any and all other Confidential Information disclosed hereunder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>    12. In the event that a party receives a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process requesting Confidential Information of the other party, the Recipient shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party and tender to it the defense of such demand.
