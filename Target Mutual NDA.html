<p>TARGET CORPORATION</p>
<p>MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT</p>
<p> Target Disclosing and Receiving Information / No Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is made as of the earlier date specified below by and between Target Corporation, its subsidiaries and affiliated entities (collectively, “Target”), and the party named below, its subsidiaries and affiliated entities (collectively, “Company”).</p>
<p>Target and Company intend to exchange confidential information in connection with their business dealings and therefore wish to enter into a mutual non-disclosure agreement.</p>
<p>Company understands that Target maintains a large staff devoted to developing its own products, services, designs, marketing strategies, business methods and the like, and is conducting research and evaluating ideas in a great many areas of interest to Target.  Target’s willingness to receive Company’s information means that Target is actively engaged in or is considering its own independently obtained information related to the information exchanged hereunder.  It is quite possible that Target has already conceived of, or is expecting to work on a project involving, the information exchanged hereunder.</p>
<p>    1. Definitions</p>
<p>        1.1. “Discloser” means either Target or Company, as applicable, when it discloses or otherwise causes Confidential Information to be available to the Recipient.</p>
<p>        1.2. “Recipient” means either Target or Company, as applicable, when it receives, handles, processes, accesses, transmits, or stores Confidential Information.</p>
<p>        1.3. “Confidential Information” means all information relating to or used in the Discloser’s business, even if it is not marked “confidential.”  Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, all business processes and procedures, systems, methods of doing business, data, reports, specifications, formulae, proposals, strategies, business plans and analyses, financial information and projections, personnel information, information about merchandising, information about past, present or potential customers, information about past, present or potential vendors, information about existing or future technology, future stores, and proprietary or third-party software.  Unless information is about past, present or potential customers or employees of Target, the term “Confidential Information” does not include information that: (a) is or becomes known to the public through no fault of Recipient; (b) Recipient rightfully possessed before receiving it from or on behalf of Discloser; (c) is subsequently disclosed to Recipient by a third-party who is not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (d) Recipient develops independently without using Confidential Information. </p>
<p>    2. Non-Disclosure Obligation.  Recipient will not disclose Confidential Information except:</p>
<p>        2.1. to its officers, directors and employees: (a) whose duties justify their need to know such Confidential Information, and (b) who have been clearly informed by Recipient of their obligation to maintain its confidentiality;</p>
<p>        2.2. to its contractors or agents: (a) whose duties justify their need to know such Confidential Information, (b) who have been clearly informed by Recipient of their obligation to maintain its confidentiality, and (c) who are bound by obligations at least as restrictive as those described in this Agreement; </p>
<p>        2.3. to the extent required by applicable federal, state or local law, regulation, court order or other legal process; provided Recipient has given Discloser prompt written notice of such required disclosure and, to the extent reasonably possible, has given Discloser an opportunity to contest such required disclosure at Discloser’s expense; or</p>
<p>        2.4. as otherwise permitted by Discloser in writing.</p>
<p>    3. Permitted Use of Confidential Information.  Recipient may use the Confidential Information, or any information that it develops based on the Confidential Information, only for the purpose for which it was disclosed.</p>
<p>    4. Protection of Confidential Information.  Recipient represents and warrants that it has taken appropriate measures to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of Confidential Information.  Recipient will use the same care to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information as Recipient uses with respect to its own confidential information of a similar nature, but no less than the care a reasonable business person would use under similar circumstances.  Discloser shall have the right to review Recipient’s operations and procedures to ensure compliance with the foregoing requirements.  Recipient will notify Discloser promptly, and shall cooperate fully, in the event of any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Confidential Information.  Notice to Target regarding such an incident shall be sent by e-mail to integrity@target.com.  Recipient shall indemnify and defend Discloser for all damages and expenses resulting from any unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of Confidential Information.</p>
<p>    5. Destruction of Confidential Information.  Upon Discloser’s written request, Recipient shall cease using and promptly arrange for the destruction of all copies (whether hard, electronic or otherwise) of any Confidential Information then in Recipient’s possession or under Recipient’s control. Recipient shall dispose of the Confidential Information in such a manner that the information cannot be read or reconstructed after destruction.  Upon Discloser’s written request, Recipient shall certify in writing that it has complied with the obligations set forth in this section.</p>
<p>    6. Ownership of Confidential Information.  Each party retains all right, title and interest in its own Confidential Information.  Neither this Agreement nor any disclosure of Confidential Information shall be deemed to grant the Recipient any license or other intellectual property right.</p>
<p>    7. Disclaimers.  Recipient agrees that Confidential Information is disclosed on an “AS IS” basis, without warranties of any kind.  Discloser does not represent or warrant that Confidential Information is accurate, complete or current.  The disclosure of Confidential Information containing business plans is for planning purposes only. Discloser may change or cancel its plans at any time at its sole discretion.  Recipient agrees that disclosure of Confidential Information does not obligate either party to enter into any type of business relationship.</p>
<p>    8. Termination.  Either party may terminate this Agreement by providing thirty (30) days written notice to the other party unless this Agreement has been incorporated into a separate, subsequent agreement.  All obligations under this Agreement with respect to Confidential Information shall survive termination.</p>
<p>    9. Injunctive Relief.  Each party acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure by Recipient of Confidential Information would likely cause immediate and irreparable harm that could not be fully remedied by monetary damages.  Each party therefore agrees that the other party may specifically enforce this Agreement and may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure without the necessity of proving actual harm.</p>
<p>    10. Notices.
