<h1>Text</h1>
<p></p>
<p>This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (this “Agreement”), effective September 10, 2015 (“Effective Date”), is entered into by and between CrowdStrike, Inc. and CrowdStrike Services, Inc., each Delaware corporations (collectively “CrowdStrike”); and Acme Technologies, Inc. (each herein referred to individually as a “Party,” or collectively as the “Parties”).  In consideration of the covenants and conditions contained herein, the Parties hereby agree to the following:</p>
<p>    1. Purpose.  The Parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest (the “Opportunity”), and in connection with the Opportunity, each Party has disclosed, and may further disclose certain confidential technical and business information (in such capacity, a Party disclosing the information, the “Discloser”) to the other Party (in such capacity, a Party receiving the information, the “Recipient”), that Discloser desires Recipient to treat as confidential.</p>
<p>    2. Confidential Information </p>
<p>        A. Definition.  “Confidential Information” means: (i) any information disclosed (directly or indirectly) by Discloser to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement that is in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form (including, without limitation, research, product plans, products, services, equipment, customers, markets, software, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, formulations, specifications, product configuration information, marketing and finance documents, prototypes, samples, data sets, and equipment) and is marked “Confidential,” “Proprietary” or in some other manner to indicate its confidential nature; (ii) oral information disclosed (directly or indirectly) by Discloser to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement; provided that such information is designated as confidential at the time of its initial disclosure and reduced to a written summary by Discloser that is marked in a manner to indicate its confidential nature and delivered to Recipient within thirty (30) days after its initial disclosure; and (iii) information otherwise reasonably expected to be treated in a confidential manner under the circumstances of disclosure under this Agreement or by the nature of the information itself.  Confidential Information may include information of a third party that is in the possession of Discloser and is disclosed to Recipient under this Agreement.  </p>
<p>        B. Exceptions.  Confidential Information shall not, however, include any information that: (i) was publicly known or made generally available without a duty of confidentiality prior to the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient; (ii) becomes publicly known or made generally available without a duty of confidentiality after disclosure by Discloser to Recipient through no wrongful action or inaction of Recipient; (iii) is in the rightful possession of Recipient without confidentiality obligations at the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient as shown by Recipient’s then-contemporaneous written files and records kept in the ordinary course of business; (iv) is obtained by Recipient from a third party without an accompanying duty of confidentiality and without a breach of such third party’s obligations of confidentiality; or (v) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information, as shown by written records and other competent evidence prepared contemporaneously with such independent development. </p>
<p>        C. Compelled Disclosure.  If Recipient becomes legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information, other than pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, Recipient will provide Discloser prompt written notice, if legally permissible, and will use its best efforts to assist Discloser in seeking a protective order or another appropriate remedy.  If Discloser waives Recipient’s compliance with this Agreement or fails to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy, Recipient will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed; provided that any Confidential Information so disclosed shall maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>    3. Non-use and Non-disclosure.  Recipient shall not use any Confidential Information of Discloser for any purpose except to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning the Opportunity.  Recipient shall not disclose any Confidential Information of Discloser to third parties or to Recipient’s employees, except that, subject to Section 4 below, Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to those employees of Recipient who are required to have such information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the Opportunity.  Recipient shall not reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile any prototypes, software, samples, or other tangible objects that embody Discloser’s Confidential Information and that are provided to Recipient under this Agreement.  </p>
<p>    4. Maintenance of Confidentiality.  Recipient shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of Discloser.  Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient shall take at least those measures that it employs to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature and shall ensure that its employees who have access to Confidential Information of Discloser have signed a non-use and non-disclosure agreement in content at least as protective of Discloser and its Confidential Information as the provisions of this Agreement, prior to any disclosure of Discloser’s Confidential Information to such employees.  Recipient shall reproduce Discloser’s proprietary rights notices on any such authorized copies in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.  Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser of any unauthorized use or disclosure, or suspected unauthorized use or disclosure, of Discloser’s Confidential Information of which Recipient becomes aware.</p>
<p>    5. No Obligation.  Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate either Party to proceed with any transaction between them, and each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the Opportunity.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to restrict either Party’s use or disclosure of its own Confidential Information.</p>
<p>    6. No Warranty.  ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS.”  NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR WITH RESPECT TO NON-INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER VIOLATION OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY OR OF RECIPIENT.</p>
<p>    7. Return of Materials.   All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information that have been disclosed by Discloser to Recipient, and all copies or extracts thereof or notes derived therefrom that are in the possession of Recipient, shall be and remain the property of Discloser and shall be promptly returned to Discloser or destroyed (with proof of such destruction), each upon Discloser’s written request.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may retain any Confidential Information that has been created electronically pursuant to automatic or ordinary course archiving, redundancy, back-up, security or disaster recovery systems or procedures; provided, however, that any such retained information shall remain subject to this Agreement.</p>
<p>    8. No License.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to Recipient under any patent, mask work right or copyright of Discloser, nor shall this Agreement grant Recipient any rights in or to the Confidential Information of Discloser except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.</p>
<p>    9. Export Restrictions.
