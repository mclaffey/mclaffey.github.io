<p></p>
<p>This Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of </p>
<p>May 5, 2015 (the “Effective Date”), by and between PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation, with a place of business at 5600 Headquarters Drive, Plano, Texas 75024 (“PepsiCo”), and Slack Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with a place of business at 155 5th Street, 6th Floor, San Francisco, California 94103 (“Company”).  As used in this Agreement, the party disclosing Confidential Information is the “Disclosing Party” and the party receiving Confidential Information is the “Receiving Party.” With respect to a party, “Representatives” means employees, contractors, consultants, agents, and professional advisors of the party. </p>
<p>        01. Purpose.  Each party hereby grants to the other party the limited right to use the other’s Confidential Information, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, for the sole purpose of (i) exploring one or more business opportunities of mutual interest and/or (ii) Company providing goods and/or services to PepsiCo pursuant to a separate written agreement between the parties (“Purpose”).  </p>
<p>        02. Confidential Information.  “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by either party to the other party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally, electronically or by inspection of tangible objects, including, without limitation, business plans, customer data, customer lists, customer names, personally identifiable information, designs, documents, electronic mail messages, databases, drawings, engineering information, financial analysis, hardware configuration information, inventions, market information, marketing plans, processes, products, product plans, research, services, specifications, software, source code, trade secrets or any other information.  Confidential Information shall not, however, include any information which either party can establish: (i) is now, or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the part of the Receiving Party, generally known or available in the public domain; (ii) the Receiving Party can demonstrate was rightfully in its possession prior to its disclosure to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party; (iii) is obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without a breach of any obligation to the Disclosing Party; or (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.  If the Receiving Party is uncertain whether any information of the Disclosing Party is Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will obtain the Disclosing Party’s written consent prior to using or disclosing such information in violation of this Agreement.  </p>
<p>        03. Obligations.  </p>
<p>a.	The Receiving Party agrees:   </p>
<p>    (i) to hold the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in strict confidence and to take at least those precautions that it takes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature (but always exercising at least a reasonable standard of care) to protect the confidentiality of, and to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of,  the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information;   </p>
<p>    (ii) not to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any third party (except as expressly permitted in Section 3.b and Section 4 below); and</p>
<p>    (iii) not to use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Purpose set forth in Section 1.</p>
<p>    b. The Receiving Party may disclose or provide access to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information only to its Representatives who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the Purpose.   Prior to the Receiving Party providing any of its Representatives with access to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will ensure that such Representatives are under an obligation of confidentiality no less protective than this Agreement to protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.  The Receiving Party agrees to promptly notify the Disclosing Party in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.  </p>
<p>        04. Required Disclosure.  The Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information if and only to the extent that such disclosure is required by any request or order of any governmental authority or by applicable law; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall (i) notify the Disclosing Party in writing of such requirement prior to disclosing and provide the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to: (A) review the disclosure and to interpose its own objection to the disclosure or (B) seek a protective order or other appropriate relief, and (ii) disclose only such information as is required by the governmental entity or otherwise required by law.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>        05. Termination of this Agreement; Survival.  This Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue until expressly terminated by either:  (i) mutual agreement in a writing executed by authorized representatives of both parties or (ii) one party providing the other party at least thirty (30) day’ prior written notice of its desire to terminate this Agreement, provided that there are no business transactions then outstanding or then in effect to which this Agreement applies between the parties.  The obligations of the Receiving Party hereunder survive any termination of this Agreement as to any Confidential Information disclosed prior to the termination of this Agreement.  The parties intend for this Agreement to apply to all Confidential Information disclosed prior to the Effective Date hereof.</p>
<p>        06. Prior Agreements. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof.  The protection of Confidential Information under any prior agreements which have not expired shall not lapse, but shall continue under the terms of this Agreement.  </p>
<p>        07. Return of Confidential Information.  Upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party will (i) promptly return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all originals and copies of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and all notes, summaries, abstracts and other documents containing the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information that are in tangible form and (ii) destroy all copies of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in its possession, power or control that are in intangible form in a manner that assures the Confidential Information is rendered unrecoverable and (iii) provide to the Disclosing Party upon request a written certification of an officer of the Receiving Party that it has complied with the foregoing obligations.</p>
<p>        08. No License.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to the Receiving Party in or to: (i) any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information except as set forth in this Agreement or (ii) any patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right of the Disclosing Party. </p>
