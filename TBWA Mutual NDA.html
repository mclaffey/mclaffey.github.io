To be clear, Confidential In formation shall also specifically include any advertising materials prepared by the Agency, unless and until such materials are publicly released with the Agency’s or its client’s authorization. Confidential Information does not include any of the foregoing items for which the non-Disclosing Party (the “Receiving Party”) can demonstrate (i) has been approved for release by written authorization of Disclosing Party; (ii) is or becomes part of information is publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) was known by Receiving Party prior to the disclosure thereof by Disclosing Party; or (iv) properly comes into the possession of Receiving Party from a third party which is not under any obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such information. The Receiving Party hereby acknowledges that all Confidential Information is and will remain the sole property of the Disclosing Party.</p>
<p></p>
<p>    2. The Receiving Party shall hold all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in the strictest confidence, not remove any copyright notice, trademark notice, and/or other proprietary legend set forth on or contained within any of the Confidential Information, and neither Party shall, at any time, disclose the nature or content of any Confidential Information belonging to the Disclosing Party to a third party unless the disclosure is authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party. In addition, Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or other government order, provided that Receiving Party shall provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice prior to any disclosure so that Disclosing Party may seek other legal remedies to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information, and Receiving Party shall comply with any applicable protective order or equivalent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>    3. Both parties agree that they shall not copy or use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, except to the extent authorized and necessary for Company to perform its services for the Agency or its clients. The Receiving Party shall only disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees and independent contractors that have a need to know such information to provide authorized services to the other party, and the Receiving Party agrees to communicate to any employees and independent contractors to whom the Receiving Party furnishes Confidential Information the confidential nature of such information and the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement that is caused by any of its employees or independent contractors, and the Receiving Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Disclosing Party and its clients from and against any liabilities, claims, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting, directly or indirectly, from any breach by the Receiving Party, or any of its employees or independent contractors, of any provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>    4. Upon the termination of Company’s services for any reason, or at any time upon the request of either party or any of their clients, the Receiving Party shall promptly return all copies of Confidential Information which are in its possession or control, including any copies, notes or extracts prepared by the Receiving Party. In the event the Receiving Party is required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or other governmental order, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice prior to any disclosure so that the Disclosing Party or its client may seek other legal remedies to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>    5. Both Parties acknowledge that the restrictions set forth herein are essential to the other Party’s business and that the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information belonging to the Disclosing Party will cause irreparable harm and significant injury to the Disclosing Party for which money damages will be inadequate. Accordingly, both Parties agree that, in addition to any other rights or remedies the Disclosing Party may have, the Disclosing Party shall have the</p>
<p></p>
<p>right to obtain an immediate injunction to enjoin any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement, without having to post a bond or other security.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflict of law principles thereof. The failure of the either Party to enforce any term or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement.</p>
<p></p>
