<p>(d) “Representative” means, with respect to a party, any equity owner of, and any officer, director, manager, employee or other agent of, and any attorney, accountant or other contractor for, such party or any of its affiliates.</p>
<p>    2. CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS</p>
<p>Each party shall:</p>
<p>        (a) Hold the other party’s Confidential Information strictly confidential and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to any third party except (i) to the receiving party’s Representatives who, solely in the course of their performance of services on behalf of the receiving party, have a need to know in order for the receiving party to carry out the purposes for which the Confidential Information was disclosed and who have an obligation to the receiving party to maintain the confidentiality of the information in a manner at least as restrictive as set forth herein; or (ii) in response to a subpoena, court order, or judicial process, provided that the disclosing party is given adequate notice of and the ability to challenge such required disclosure and the receiving party shall cooperate (at the disclosing party’s expense) with any efforts to prevent or limit such required disclosure.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the receiving party receives Privacy Information, such party may disclose Privacy Information only as permitted by a Privacy Law; and</p>
<p>        (b) Use Confidential Information disclosed to it solely for the purpose for which it was disclosed. </p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party may keep copies of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in accordance with its record retention policies established for the purpose of compliance with applicable laws and regulations or credit, audit, or other legitimate internal corporate purposes, provided that such Confidential Information shall remain subject to the terms of this NDA.  Further, notwithstanding the return or destruction of any Confidential Information, the receiving party and its Representatives shall continue to be and remain fully bound by this NDA. Additionally, if the receiving party disposes of any media upon which the disclosing party’s Privacy Information is stored, the receiving party shall physically destroy such media by complete obliteration so that its contents are completely unreadable and indecipherable or sanitize such media prior to such disposal using an industry standard method of data sanitization which completely and irreversibly removes or destroys all data using a sufficient number of passes to ensure that there are no remnants remaining on any part of such media and no forensically retrievable data on such media.  </p>
<p>    6. NO OBLIGATION OR WARRANTY</p>
<p>Neither party has an obligation under this NDA to purchase from or provide to the other party any service, goods, or intangibles.  The parties acknowledge and agree that the exchange of information under this NDA shall not commit or bind either party to any present or future contractual relationship nor shall the exchange of information be construed as an inducement to act or not to act in any given manner.  Neither party makes any representations or warranties to the other party or to any other person or entity under this NDA with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, and all Confidential Information is provided “AS IS.”  Neither party shall be liable to the other in any manner whatsoever for any decisions, obligations, costs or expenses incurred, changes in business practices, plans, organization, products, services, or otherwise, based on either party’s decision to use or rely on any information exchanged under this NDA.  Further, neither this NDA, nor any disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder, in any way: (i) limits either party or any of their respective affiliates from developing, manufacturing or marketing products or services which may be competitive with those of the other party (provided that such activities do not in any way violate this NDA); or (ii) limits either party or any of their respective affiliates from entering into any business relationship with any other parties (provided that this NDA is not violated in any way).</p>
<p>    7. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</p>
<p>It is agreed that the unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information may cause immediate or irreparable injury to the disclosing party, and that such party cannot be adequately compensated for such injury in monetary damages.  Each party therefore acknowledges and agrees that, in such event, the disclosing party shall be entitled to seek any temporary or permanent injunctive relief necessary to prevent such unauthorized disclosure or use, or threat of disclosure or use, without the requirement of posting a bond.</p>
<p>    8. GOVERNING LAW</p>
<p>This NDA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws.  </p>
<p>    9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT/ SEVERABILITY</p>
<p>This NDA constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter addressed herein and may not be amended or modified except by written agreement, signed by both parties hereto. The unenforceability of any provision of this NDA shall not affect the enforceability of the remainder of this NDA.</p>
<p>    10. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS</p>
<p>This NDA shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.</p>
<p>    11. NOTICES</p>
<p>All notices required under this NDA shall be in writing and delivered to the addresses set forth above.  Such notices shall be deemed given on the date of receipt (or refusal) of said notice.  Either party may designate a different address for receipt of notices upon written notice to the other party.</p>
<p>    12. ATTORNEYS’ FEES</p>
<p>If a party retains the services of an attorney to enforce the provisions of this NDA, the non-defaulting party, or prevailing party in an action if an action is filed, shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in such enforcement proceeding or action, including all appeals.</p>
<p>    13. TERM; INTENT</p>
<p>The term of this NDA shall commence on the Effective Date and continue in effect until terminated by either party at any time upon written notice to the other; provided, however, that the obligations set forth herein shall survive any termination of this NDA with respect to the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder during the term hereof. Except as otherwise specifically agreed to by the parties in writing to the contrary, the parties intend that this NDA shall not be superseded or terminated in any way by, and shall survive, the consummation or termination of any subsequent transaction, agreement or business relationship between the parties.</p>
<p>    14. counterparts; electronic transmission and e-signature</p>
<p>This NDA may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one single agreement between the parties. Any executed signature page to this NDA may be transmitted by facsimile or other electronic transmission to the other party, which shall constitute an original signature for all purposes. Additionally, for purposes of this NDA, the NDA is "signed" or "executed" if it includes a symbol or action that is adopted or performed by the signer with the present intent to authenticate, manifest acceptance of or assent to the NDA (an "E-Signature”).  If an E-signature is affixed below through the use of an E-signature application, it shall be deemed to be an original signature as if handwritten below and no certification authority or other third party verification is necessary to validate the E-Signature of any party or any agreement between the parties resulting from an E-Signature.</p>
