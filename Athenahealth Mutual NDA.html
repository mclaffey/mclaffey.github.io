<h1>Text</h1>
<p>NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT</p>
<p>This Non-Disclosure Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of the Effective Date (defined below) by and between athenahealth, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for itself and its subsidiaries, having its principal place of business at 311 Arsenal Street, Watertown, Massachusetts 02472 (“Athena”), and the following counterparty:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Athena and Company are each referred to herein as a “Party,” and collectively as the “Parties.”</p>
<p>    1. Purpose. In connection with a possible business transaction (the “Purpose”), the Parties desire to share certain information that is non-public, confidential, or proprietary in nature. The terms “Disclosing Party” and “Receiving Party” refer respectively to the Party disclosing or receiving Confidential Information (defined below).</p>
<p>    2. Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means all non-public, confidential, or proprietary information of Disclosing Party that is disclosed by Disclosing Party or its Representatives (defined below) to Receiving Party or its Representatives that (a) Receiving Party knows is confidential to Disclosing Party or (b) is of such a nature that someone familiar with Disclosing Party’s line of business would reasonably understand is confidential to it. Without limitation, Confidential Information includes commercially valuable, proprietary, and confidential business information with respect to Disclosing Party’s business, finances, employees, clients, client’s patients, products, services, software, or network, including, without limitation, oral information and tangible and intangible property that may contain or relate to source code and object code, data and data structures, hardware and software designs and specifications, web site designs and applications, network topology, functionality specifications, security measures, trade secrets, know-how, business plans, financial plans, capital structure, employee information, and client information.</p>
<p>    3. Exclusions. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available or readily ascertainable without breach of this Agreement; (b) is shown by written records to have been in Receiving Party’s lawful possession prior to disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) is lawfully received by Receiving Party from a third party without an obligation of confidentiality to Disclosing Party; (d) is independently developed by Receiving Party without reference to or use of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or (e) is disclosed by Receiving Party with Disclosing Party’s prior written consent.</p>
<p>    4. Use and Non-Disclosure. Receiving Party agrees that it shall only use Confidential Information in connection with the Purpose. Receiving Party agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information and to prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure, dissemination or publication of Confidential Information, and it shall use no less degree of care with respect to protection of the confidentiality of the Confidential Information as Receiving Party uses to protect its own information of a similar sensitive nature.</p>
<p>    5. Representatives. Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to any officers, directors, employees, agents, subcontractors, attorneys, accountants, auditors, consultants, representatives, investment bankers, banks, or other financing sources of Receiving Party or its affiliates (collectively, “Representatives”) who or which (a) have a need to know Confidential Information to evaluate or carry out the Purpose, (b) are informed or otherwise know of the confidential nature of Confidential Information, and (c) are subject to confidentiality duties or obligations to Receiving Party that are no less restrictive than the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>    6. Required Disclosure. In the event that Receiving Party or any of its Representatives receives a request or demand to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information under the terms of a subpoena or order or investigative request issued by a court or government agency, Receiving Party agrees to promptly notify Disclosing Party of the existence, terms, and circumstances surrounding such a request so that Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief or remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>    7. Term and Termination. The obligations of Receiving Party and its Representatives as described in this Agreement shall commence as of the date (the “Effective Date”) which is the earlier of (a) the date on which either Receiving Party receives or has received any Confidential Information or (b) the date on which this Agreement is signed by the last Party executing this Agreement. Unless the Parties execute and consummate a definitive agreement respecting the Purpose that contains confidentiality provisions, the term of this Agreement shall continue indefinitely, irrespective of the return or destruction of any Confidential Information by Receiving Party. Either Party may terminate this Agreement with 30 days prior written notice, but this Agreement’s provisions will survive as to Confidential Information that is disclosed before termination. Disclosing Party may request the return or destruction of its Confidential Information at any time or from time to time and Receiving Party will promptly comply.</p>
<p>    8. No Representations or Warranties. Neither Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of Confidential Information disclosed to Receiving Party or its Representatives. All Confidential Information disclosed hereunder is provided by Disclosing Party on an “as is” basis and without any representation or warranty of any kind.</p>
<p>    9. No Transfer. All right, title, and interest in and to the Confidential Information will remain the property of Disclosing Party. No disclosure or use of Confidential Information permitted under this Agreement should be construed as granting to Receiving Party any license or right to use, exploit, or replicate any Confidential Information or any patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right or proprietary right of Disclosing Party in or to such Confidential Information.</p>
<p>    10. No Obligation. The Parties agree that neither Party shall be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever, or otherwise be obligated to enter into any business or contractual relationship, investment, or transaction, by virtue of this Agreement. Each Party agrees that either Party shall have the right, in its sole discretion, without giving any reason therefor, at any time to terminate discussions concerning the Purpose. This Agreement does not create any agency, joint venture, or partner relationship.</p>
<p>    11. Injunctive Relief. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that money damages might not be a sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by such Party or its Representatives. Therefore, each Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance or other equitable relief as a remedy for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for the breach or threatened breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available to Disclosing Party at law or in equity. Receiving Party agrees that the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to apply, with equal force and effect, to any of its Representatives and that Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.</p>
<p>    12. Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict of laws principles.</p>
<p>    13.
