<p>Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement</p>
<p>This Agreement is made effective as of this 8th day of April, 2015 (the “Effective Date”) by and between COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (“Company”), and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., a California corporation, its parent and their respective affiliates, joint venturers, franchisees, and subsidiaries (“Schwab”).</p>
<p>Recitals</p>
<p>	WHEREAS, Company and Schwab are considering entering into a business arrangement; and</p>
<p>	WHEREAS, Company and Schwab each desire to review and discuss certain proprietary and confidential information of the other party in connection with their analysis of the proposed business arrangement (the “Analysis”); and</p>
<p>	WHEREAS, Company and Schwab each desire that all of their respective confidential and proprietary information revealed to the other party be subject to the confidentiality and non-disclosure restrictions imposed by this Agreement.</p>
<p>Agreement</p>
<p>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:</p>
<p>	1.	Definition of Confidential Information. The term “Confidential Information” means all information or material which:  (i) gives a party some competitive business advantage or the opportunity of obtaining such advantage or the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the interests of a party; or (ii) is either (a) marked “Confidential,” “Restricted,” or “Proprietary Information” or other similar marking, (b) known by the parties to be considered confidential and proprietary, or (c) from all the relevant circumstances should reasonably be known to be confidential and proprietary.  By way of example and not limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (i) any information concerning a party’s, its agents’ or licensors’ technology, such as systems, source code, databases, hardware, software, programs, applications, engine protocols, routines, models, displays and manuals, including, without limitation, the selection, coordination, and arrangement of the contents thereof; and (ii) any information concerning a party’s, its agents’ or licensors’ financial or business plans or operations, such as research activities and plans, marketing or sales plans, pricing or pricing strategies, operational techniques, internal controls, compliance policies, methods of operation, security procedures, strategic plans, Customer and Employee Information (as defined below), and unpublished financial information, including information concerning revenues, profits and profit margins.</p>
<p>	2.	Restrictions on Use.  The party providing Confidential Information in each case shall be called the “Disclosing Party” and the party receiving the Confidential Information shall be called the “Receiving Party”.  The Receiving Party shall not use, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, any portion of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Analysis.  Each party agrees that:  </p>
<p>(a)	it will hold the Confidential Information of the other party in the strictest confidence; </p>
<p>(b)	it will exercise no less care with respect to the other party’s Confidential Information than the level of care exercised with respect to its own Confidential Information; </p>
<p>(c)	it will not, without the other party’s prior written consent, copy or disclose to any third party any portion thereof; </p>
<p>	(d)	it will notify immediately the other party of any unauthorized disclosure or use, and will cooperate with the other to protect all proprietary rights in and ownership of its Confidential Information; and</p>
<p>(e)	it will restrict dissemination of the Confidential Information of the other party to only those persons within or related to its organization who are directly involved in the Analysis, and who are bound by terms substantially similar to the terms set forth herein.</p>
<p>	3.	Exceptions.  The foregoing shall not prohibit or limit the Receiving Party’s use, disclosure, reproduction or dissemination of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information which:</p>
<p>(a)	is or becomes public domain information or material through no fault or breach on the part of the Receiving Party;</p>
<p>(b)	as demonstrated by the written records of the Receiving Party, was already lawfully known (without restriction on disclosure) to the Receiving Party prior to the information being disclosed to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party or any representative of the Disclosing Party;</p>
<p>(c)	has been or is hereafter rightfully furnished to the Receiving Party without restriction on disclosure by a third person lawfully in possession thereof;</p>
<p>(d)	has been independently developed, by or for the Receiving Party, without reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; or</p>
<p>(e)	is required to be disclosed, but only to the extent required, by court order, or pursuant to applicable law, regulation or self-regulatory organization rules, provided that the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party so that the Disclosing Party may have a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order or other form of protection against disclosure.  Notwithstanding any such compelled disclosure by the Receiving Party, such compelled disclosure will not otherwise affect the Receiving Party’s obligations hereunder with respect to Confidential Information, including Customer and Employee Information, so disclosed. </p>
<p>	It shall be presumed that any Confidential Information in the possession of the Receiving Party that has been disclosed to it by the Disclosing Party or any representative of the Disclosing Party is not within any of the exceptions above, and the burden is on the Receiving Party to prove otherwise by records and documentation.</p>
<p>	4.	Engagement of Services.  In the event that work is performed by Company for Schwab for compensation, and without the execution of a formal professional services agreement by and between Company and Schwab, the provisions of this Section 4 shall apply.  Schwab shall own and, to the extent permissible under applicable law, Company hereby assigns to Schwab all proprietary rights in any and all inventions conceived or reduced to practice by Company for Schwab, and in any and all other works of authorship fixed in a tangible means of expression by Company for Schwab.  If requested by Schwab, Company will sign documents and otherwise assist Schwab, at Schwab’s cost, in perfecting such ownership and obtaining patents and registering copyrights.  If Schwab requires assistance for more than a nominal amount of Company’s time, Schwab will compensate Company for that time at Company’s then current consulting rates, provided that they are commercially reasonable.  If implementing any recommendation made to Schwab for compensation or if making, using, selling, copying or distributing any deliverable provided to Schwab for compensation would infringe any patent or copyright owned or controlled by Company, Schwab will have a permanent, assignable, worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) under all such patents and copyrights to do all things necessary to implement all such recommendations, to make, use, sell, copy and distribute all such deliverables and copies of all such deliverables, to create works of authorship derived from such deliverables, and to use, copy and distribute any such derivative works.</p>
<p>	5.	No License.  Except as provided in Section 4, this Agreement shall not be construed as granting or conferring any rights to either party by license or otherwise, expressly or implicitly, to Confidential Information, Customer and Employee Information, or any invention, discovery or improvement made, conceived or acquired prior to or after the Effective Date.</p>
