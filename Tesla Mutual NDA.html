<h1>Text</h1>
<p>THIS MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of the date indicated above (the “Effective Date”) between Tesla Motors, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tesla”), and _____________________, a(n) _____________________ (“Company”).  Tesla and Company hereby agree as follows:</p>
<p>    1. Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” shall mean information disclosed by one party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”), subject to the exceptions in Section 6 below, and may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets, physical samples, financial, business, sales or technical information, terms of agreements, negotiations or proposals, all data, and such other information disclosed (a) in written  or other tangible form and marked “Confidential” or with words of similar import, (b) orally or visually and identified as confidential or proprietary information at the time of disclosure, or (c) under circumstances by which Receiving Party should reasonably understand such information is to be treated as confidential, whether or not marked “Confidential” or otherwise.  </p>
<p>    2. Purpose. Disclosing Party and/or its Affiliates may disclose Confidential Information to Receiving Party and/or its Affiliates for the sole purpose of (a) considering a potential business relationship with each other, and/or (b) fulfilling the objectives of such business relationship (collectively, the “Purpose”). </p>
<p>    3. Non-Use and Non-Disclosure Obligations. Subject to Section 6 of this Agreement, Receiving Party agrees not to: (a) use Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information for any reason, other than as required for the Purpose; and (b) disclose Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any individual or third party except to its employees, consultants, directors, and Affiliates that (i) have a “need to know” such Confidential Information for furtherance of the Purpose, and (ii) are bound to confidentiality under terms no less protective than the terms of this Agreement (collectively, “Authorized Recipients”).  Receiving Party shall implement and maintain appropriate organizational, technical, and administrative security measures, exercising the same degree of care in protecting Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information that it uses for its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care.  Promptly after becoming aware of any unauthorized use or disclosure of, and/or unauthorized attempts to access or modify, any of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in the custody or control of Receiving Party or its Authorized Recipients, Receiving Party shall notify Disclosing Party in writing and cooperate with Disclosing Party to investigate and mitigate any adverse effects therefrom.  Receiving Party shall be responsible for any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information by any of its Authorized Recipients.</p>
<p>    4. De-identified or Anonymous Data. Tesla may, in its sole discretion, share certain de-identified or anonymous data, which is data that cannot be used to identify an individual (“Anonymous Data”).  Company will not, and will not attempt to, (a) re-identify any de-identified or anonymous data or (b) identify the individual with whom such data is associated.</p>
<p>    5. No Publicity. Each party agrees that it shall not make any public disclosures relating to the existence of this Agreement or the Purpose without the prior written consent of the other party. </p>
<p>    6. Exceptions. The obligations of Section 3 of this Agreement shall not apply to information (other than Anonymous Data) that: (a) is already known to Receiving Party or its Affiliates at the time of disclosure without obligation of confidentiality to Disclosing Party, (b) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act or omission of Receiving Party or its Affiliates, (c) is rightfully received by Receiving Party or its Affiliates from a third party without obligation of confidentiality, (d) is approved for release by written authorization of Disclosing Party, or (e) was developed by Receiving Party or its Affiliates independently and without the use or benefit of any of the Confidential Information.  A disclosure of Confidential Information that is required to be made by Receiving Party pursuant to any request, order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or any other governmental agency shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement, provided that Receiving Party has: (x) immediately notified Disclosing Party in writing of such, request, order or requirement, (y) given Disclosing Party an opportunity to contest disclosure or seek an appropriate protective order, and (z) cooperated with Disclosing Party to narrow the scope of such disclosure to only that portion of the Confidential Information that is necessary to fulfill the request, order or requirement.</p>
<p>    7. Ownership. All Confidential Information and derivations thereof shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Disclosing Party and no license or other right to such Confidential Information or either party’s intellectual property is granted or implied hereby.</p>
<p>    8. As-Is Disclosures. Disclosing Party warrants that it has the right to disclose the Confidential Information to Receiving Party.  Except for the foregoing, (a) no other warranties are made whether express, implied or statutory, (b) all Confidential Information is provided on an “AS IS” basis, and (c) no representation, warranty, assurance, or guarantee is made by Disclosing Party with respect to the accuracy, performance, completeness, or suitability of the Confidential Information or non-infringement of third-party rights based on use of the Confidential Information by Receiving Party.</p>
<p>    9. Current and Future Development. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or inference that Receiving Party will not develop, or have developed, products or services that, without violation of this Agreement, compete with the products or services of Disclosing Party.</p>
<p>    10. Return of Confidential Information. Confidential Information, and all copies thereof, remain the property of Disclosing Party.  Upon termination of this Agreement or the written request of Disclosing Party, Receiving Party shall promptly return to Disclosing Party all documents, presentations, and other tangible items of Confidential Information furnished by Disclosing Party or, at the request of Disclosing Party, certify in writing that all such Confidential Information has been destroyed.  Receiving Party shall also use reasonable efforts to delete all electronic copies of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information under the Receiving Party’s control.  </p>
<p>    11. Affiliate. As used herein, “Affiliate” shall mean an entity which: (a) controls or is controlled by a party hereto or (b) is under common control with a party hereto: where “control” means that more than fifty percent (>50%) of the controlled entity’s shares or ownership interest representing the right to make decisions for such entity are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the controlling entity.  </p>
<p>    12. Notices. Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement shall be made in writing and be deemed delivered upon verification of delivery to the other party.</p>
<p>    13. Termination of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Effective Date.
